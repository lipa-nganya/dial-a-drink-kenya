🔧 QUICK FIX: Enable Places API

The error "ApiNotActivatedMapError" means Places API is not enabled.

1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library
2. Search "Places API" → Click "Enable"
3. Search "Maps JavaScript API" → Click "Enable"  
4. Wait 1-2 minutes
5. Refresh your browser

That's it! The autocomplete will work after enabling these APIs.
